## Introduction
We have already familiarized ourselves with variables of different types, such as integers, symbols and strings. But let's get back to the main question: why do we start coding? What exactly do we want to create? In this section, we will consider two main motivations for programming: creation and automation.

## Creation
One of the main reasons why we start coding is the desire to create something new. Programming gives us the opportunity to turn our ideas into reality. We can develop applications, websites, games and other programs that solve certain tasks or just entertain users. Creating our own projects can be an inspiring and satisfying process, allowing us to express our creative side and share our ideas with other people.

## Automation
Another important aspect of programming is automation. When we write programs, we can teach the computer to perform certain tasks for us. It can be the automation of routine and repetitive tasks that take a lot of time and tire us. Programming helps us create scripts and programs that can process data, perform calculations, interact with other programs, and much more. Automation allows us to work more efficiently and use our time efficiently.

## Both together!
Often our motivations for programming are combined. Creating new projects may also include automating certain tasks. We can develop applications that not only solve specific problems, but also simplify the daily actions of users. Coding provides us with a means to realize our ideas and aspirations, whether it's creating a new product, improving an existing one, or optimizing processes.

### So go ahead, keep coding and explore the possibilities that programming provides!!!
